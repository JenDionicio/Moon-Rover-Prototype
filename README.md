# Moon-Rover-Prototype

#### This program file is the code used for a built robot that is able to move physical objects from different locations and heights in a Mars-like terrain. This code used the signals from a gyro sensor to calculate distance from objects and turning direction cordinate via a x-y polarity inverse equation.
